# alphaforge
This is an simplified and unofficial implementation of AlphaForge: A Framework to Mine and Dynamically Combine Formulaic Alpha Factors.

The framework is completely decoupled with qlib and the origin implementation of Alphagen, and you are allowed to use your own data source as well as your own label. The key parameters, such as the max length of the alpha formular and the look back window of the operators, can also be easliy adjusted. A simple demo is provided in the jupyter notebook.
